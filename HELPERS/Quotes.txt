I refuse to accept other people's ideas of happiness for me. As if there's a 'one size fits all' standard for happiness.

We all self-conscious. I'm just the first to admit it.
George Bush doesn't care about black people.
I would hear stories about Steve Jobs and feel like he was at 100 percent exactly what he wanted to do, but I'm sure even a Steve Jobs has compromised. Even a Rick Owens has compromised. You know, even a Kanye West has compromised. Sometimes you don't even know when you're being compromised till after the fact, and that's what you regret.
I am Warhol. I am the No. 1 most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh.

If you see a black family, it's looting, but if it's a white family they are looking for food.
I'll say things that are serious and put them in a joke form so people can enjoy them. We laugh to keep from crying.
People always say that you can't please everybody. I think that's a cop-out. Why not attempt it? 'Cause think of all the people you will please if you try.
It was a strike against me that I didn't wear baggy jeans and jerseys and that I never hustled, never sold drugs.
But for me to have the opportunity to stand in front of a bunch of executives and present myself, I had to hustle in my own way. I can't tell you how frustrating it was that they didn't get that. No joke - I'd leave meetings crying all the time.
